## Under Construction

I am a PhD student in mathematics at the [Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences](http://maxwell.ac.uk/), the joint research centre of the University of Edinburgh and Heriot Watt University.  I am co-supervised by [Dr Marcelo Pereyra](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp71/) and [Dr Kostas Zygalakis](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people?person=506), as part of the Graduate School in Analysis and its Applications [(MIGSAA)](http://maxwell.ac.uk/migsaa/).

For a better example of the sort of work done by MIGSAA students, see the [Tom Hodgson's site](https://tom271.github.io).
